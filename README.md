### Hi there 👋

💻 A web developer, learned most of my trade from internet, self experimenting and from amazing people I work with.

🌱 Usually I work with ReactJS and Ruby on Rails, but currently I am learning to build an optimized web blog with other technologies ✨.

🧶 Besides coding, I also like to design and make cute crafty doll projects with yarn, [here at https://pawlarius.com 🧶](https://pawlarius.com/).
