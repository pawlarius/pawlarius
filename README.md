### Hi there 👋

A web developer, learned most of my trade from internet, self experimenting and from amazing people I am working with.

Usually I work with ReactJS and Ruby on Rails, but currently I am learning to build an optimized web blog with other technologies ✨.

Besides coding, I also like to design and make cute crafty doll projects with yarn, [you can check it out here 🧶](https://www.instagram.com/pawlarius.crafts/).
